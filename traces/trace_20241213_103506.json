Keeping Tabs on Qlik Cloud Reporting It\u2019s here! Tabular Reporting in Qlik Cloud\n\n[![Headshot of blog author Julianne DeVincenzo.

I\u2019ve just finished typing up my last homework assignment of the year, and a few loud keyboard taps later, it\u2019s saved to a floppy disk, ready for printing at the school library. I grab my headphones and press play on my Walkman: Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumors. It\u2019s an old tape that belonged to my dad, and despite my favorite musician of all time, Stevie Nicks, joining their band almost 16 years before I was born, their otherworldly and soulful vocal harmonies never fail to bring me joy.\n\n![A grid of nine illustrated retro tech items, including a Tamagotchi, boombox, floppy disk, flip phone, cassette tape, Game Boy, portable cassette player, personal computer, and VHS tape.](https://res.cloudinary.com/talend/image/upload/w_600/q_auto/qlik/blogs/blog-post/spot-blog-keeping-tabs-on-qlik-cloud-reporting_imnndu.png) We all have memories like this. Whether it was your first computer, or that feeling when you first heard the dial-up tone for internet, certain technologies have a special place in our hearts and for many Qlik Customers those technologies include Excel and NPrinting. _At the early beginning, Vizubi NPrinting, was the printing (and exporting to Excel) module of a bigger product called Nuvola (the Italian word for cloud). The NPrinting code was extracted and translated to English to be sold worldwide via internet._ Beyond look and feel, the capabilities and familiarity associated with our favorite tech can usher in a powerful sense of nostalgia.\n\nHere is our tribute to nostalgia, an appreciation of marrying the past with the present driving entirely new innovations\u2026 [Tabular Reporting](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Reporting/cloud-tabular-reports-intro.htm) available in Qlik Cloud Analytics. The holidays came early for many Qlik users when Qlik launched Tabular Reporting in December, bringing a beloved QlikView NPrinting feature to the cloud. Tabular reporting capabilities have been a fundamental aspect of Qlik\u2019s reporting software dating back to QlikView. At its core, it enables users to organize and share data with stakeholders in structured table formats. There\u2019s a reason people still love and use Excel.\n\nWhile Tabular Reporting functionality has evolved over time, with Qlik continuously refining and improving the user experience, this beloved feature was originally left out of the reporting capabilities of Qlik Cloud Analytics. Until now\u2026 So \u2014 what exactly is Tabular Reporting with Qlik Cloud? What can it be used for? What is the state of this technology today? Let\u2019s get into it.\n\nCustomers now have the capability to conquer those ever-present, report distribution requirements. Whether you need paginated tables of sales/transactional data or repeated sheets of departmental analysis directly within an application in Qlik Cloud, we got you\u2026 With the introduction of Tabular Reporting, report developers can unleash their creativity, crafting tailor-made, intricately detailed XLS or PDF documents infused with Qlik data and visualizations.\n\nHighlights of Tabular Reporting:\n\n* **Create** dynamic tabular report template definition with data and visualizations from a Qlik Sense App from the familiarity of Microsoft Office 365 using Add-in technology.\n\n* **Define** report templates of Qlik data and visualizations and produce reports in PDF and Excel.\n\n* **Share** branded, presentation ready burst reports with internal and external stakeholders, with the self-service subscription ability to set up alerts.\n\n* **Manage** in app distribution lists to support burst distribution to any internal or external stakeholder.\n\n* **Control** with governed report task control from within an integrated report preparation experience.\n\n_And the cherry on top?_ Governed Report Tasks swoop in to burst reports to every corner of your distribution universe. Used for external stakeholder requirements, compliance agency reports and customers, allowing people without a license to consume insights generated by Qlik Cloud. Further solidifying the Qlik Cloud platform as the go-to source for operational decisions, customer communications, and beyond!\n\nQlik reporting capabilities will continue to expand with new features and functions that enhance collaboration and enables users to leverage the insights derived from reports across their organizations.\n\nIf you are hungry to learn how to use these collaborative and tabular reporting features and want an in-person, hands-on workshop then you are in luck. Come out to Orlando for [Qlik Connect ](https://www.qlikconnect.com/event/b6714110-5f41-4df1-9735-6b0007500a2e/websitePage:d8250be0-b1b9-4524-b2e8-cd8508c14979?utm_campaign=7013z000001vmSqAAI&utm_content=QlikInternal&utm_medium=qlikinternal&utm_mpt_id=CXJHBW&utm_source=Internal&utm_team=COM&utm_term=Internal)in June.

So why wait? Pour yourself a cup of coffee, fire up your browser, and experience the features you have been longing for. Your data \u2014 and your stakeholders \u2014 will thank you.\n\nWant to \u2018keep tabs\u2019 on Tabular Reporting and other Qlik Cloud Reporting updates on the horizon?

[Read Customer Story](/us/resource-library/qlik-empowers-company-wide-insights-with-embedding)\n\n1300 ### Active users More than one third of the company actively takes advantage of analytics, integrating data into presentations, websites, applications, and other business products.\n\n10X ### Increase in usage Intuit didn\u2019t have to provide user training for the portal. The ease and consistency of the UI and UX helped create a more data-driven company with a modern, accessible approach.\n\n1 ### Company-wide portal Users can modify dashboards quickly and easily with an intuitive drag and drop UI.\n\nCHALLENGE ## Company data was too complex and difficult to use The complexity of their data setup put a high cognitive load on employees. And because analytics were not automatically updated across various platforms, leaders got reports and gave presentations using information that wasn\u2019t always up to date.\n\nAPPROACH ## An easy-to-use portal makes data accessible and usable Data from both Qlik Sense\u00ae and other third-party sources like AWS flow into the One Intuit Portal through Qlik Sense\u2019s API integrations. The APIs also create reusable components that can serve as embedded analytics. Intuit\u2019s end users then consume the data via a single page application on the React framework.\n\nRESULTS ## Quicker decisions based on real-time analytics The embedded analytics enabled by Qlik Sense\u2019s APIs are a game changer. Embedded analytics seamlessly integrate analytic content into other business products, websites and applications.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU ## The easier to use, the better Putting the time into making complex data analytics easy to consume pays dividends. Intuit always valued data, but now it is a more data-driven company with a modern, accessible approach. Over the past two years, usage has grown 10x for the embedded analytics the team supports.\n\n## Here\u2019s what other customers are saying > We needed to consolidate data in one place, from heterogeneous sources, updated in almost real-time. That\u2019s what Qlik enables for us. ### C\u00e9dric Brignol Project Manager, Airbus\n\n## Resources to help you gain insights in minutes [![Front view of an Airbus aircraft on a runway with the word \\\"AIRBUS\\\" overlaid on the image.](https://res.cloudinary.com/talend/image/upload/w_423/q_auto/qlik/resource-library/customer-story/resource-cs-airbus_tax0i4.jpg)Customer StoryAirbus Consolidates Data Sources to Optimize Aircraft ProductionRead Customer Story](/us/resource-library/airbus-consolidates-data-sources-to-optimize-aircraft-production)\n\n---\n\n**Article: 12**\nURL: https://www.qlik.com/us/solutions/customers/customer-stories/dominos\nContent: Domino's Radically Improves Efficiency, Customer Service \u2014 and Sales with Real-time Data and Analytics\n\nDomino's has leveraged real-time data and analytics to enhance operational efficiency and customer service.\n\nThis transformation has led to significant improvements in sales performance.\n\nVirtual EventVisionary Voices Episode 6: Cloud, AI, and the Analytics RevolutionExplore how AI is supercharging analytics in the series finale of Visionary Voices in AI.Learn More\n\nCustomer StoriesMore than 40,000 customers find answers with Qlik.\n\nAnalyticsTake action with AI-powered insightLearn More\n\nCUSTOMER STORYIntuit Simplifies Analytics with a Company-wide PortalRead More\n\nDomino's Radically Improves Efficiency, Customer Service \u2014 and Sales with Real-time Data and AnalyticsRead More\n\nUrban Outfitters Reduces Store Level Reporting from Hours to MinutesRead More\n\nData Research Went From Thousands of Hours to Near Real Time at Georgia-PacificRead More\n\nView Customer Stories\n\nCASE STUDY // DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA\n\nReal-time Data and Analytics Radically Improve Efficiency, Customer Service \u2014 and Sales Emphasis on innovation helps Domino\u2019s achieve more than 50 percent of all global retail sales from digital channels.\n\n85,000\n\ndata sources integrated\n\nStructured and unstructured data sources were integrated to get a single view of its customers and global operations.\n\n17TB\n\nof standardized managed data\n\nBusiness intelligence and advanced analytics required a streamlined and standardized architecture.\n\n1\n\ncentralized data tracker\n\nData is collected from the company\u2019s point of sales systems, 26 supply chain centers, and its channels.\n\nCHALLENGE\n\nWorld\u2019s largest pizza company was drowning in data\n\nThere are more than 15,000 stores in 85-plus markets, with customer data pouring in from every conceivable platform.\n\nThe company wanted to integrate all that data \u2014 85,000 structured and unstructured data sources \u2014 to get a single view of its customers and global operations.\n\nUnfortunately, their IT architecture prevented it.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a standard way to ingest data,\u201d says Dan Djuric, Vice President, Global Infrastructure and Enterprise Information Management.\n\n\u201c We also had more than 11,000 business users, 35 data scientists, and multiple marketing agencies \u2014 and all of them wanted to build their own database.\u201d\n\nAPPROACH\n\nA unified platform that manages data and provides real-time insight and analytics\n\nDomino\u2019s selected Talend\u00ae Data Fabric.\n\nThey also built a comprehensive data tracker which feeds Domino\u2019s Enterprise Management Framework and real-time data streaming.\n\nIt\u2019s combined with third party visualization and analytics solutions.\n\nWith a modern data platform in place, Domino\u2019s now has a trusted, single source of truth that helps improve business performance \u2014 from logistics to financial forecasting \u2014 while enabling one-to-one buying experiences across multiple touchpoints.\n\n\u201cWe think of it as giving store managers a smart watch for their in-store operations,\u201d said Kripakar Krishnamurthy, Director, Enterprise Data Engineering, Platforms and Architecture at Domino\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe want them to have reliable information about what\u2019s happening right now so they can maximize efficiency, deliver a superior customer experience, and boost their sales.\u201d\n\nRESULTS\n\nE-commerce with pepperoni\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become an e-commerce company that sells pizza. Talend has helped us make that digital transformation,\u201d exclaimed Djuric.\n\nWith real-time data and analytics, store managers can quickly see daily orders, prep time, delivery vs. pick-up, and more.\n\nThey can project demand and forecast staffing requirements.\n\n\u201cWe were already producing a lot of real-time information, and now put it to better use,\u201d Krishnamurthy noted.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our store managers to see what\u2019s ahead and make the right moves.\u201d\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU\n\nData is only worth what you can do with it\n\nVast data and multiple sources can be an untapped resource.\n\nBut it can also tap other resources as you attempt to analyze or contextualize it.\n\nBut a unified, agile, scalable data platform can capture, cleanse, standardize, enrich, store, and distribute data.\n\nIt becomes an asset.\n\nDjuric observes, \u201cWe\u2019re an aggressively aspirational company, and store growth is very important.\n\nWe needed to make sure we were on a platform that could scale, and Talend fulfills that requirement.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what other customers are saying\n\nWe needed to consolidate data in one place, from

from Hours to Minutes\n\nRetail leader uses real-time data to support in-the-moment decisions.\n\n50GB\n\nDaily streamed data\n\nRapid real-time data access boosts store performance by giving staff the information they need when they need it.\n\n240+\n\nQlik apps in use\n\nStore staff can make quick decisions, see current challenges, plan for the future, and appreciate the impact their work has on the wider picture.\n\n650+\n\nStore locations worldwide\n\nAccess to an array of dashboards and reports updated with fresh data every two minutes enables quick, in-store decision-making.\n\nCHALLENGE\n\nData was locked inside 650-plus stores\n\nGathering actionable data from more than 650 stores spread throughout the USA, Europe, and UK was a huge problem.\n\nTime zones, operating styles of three business brands, and different information systems created remarkable challenges.\n\nCovid-19 made it even worse, because of store closures and inconsistent pandemic strategies.\n\n\u201cWe were dealing with many different systems and technologies, so we could not easily gather, explore, or learn from information,\u201d said Director of Workforce Management, Joanna Matthy.\n\n\u201cIt meant that reports had to be cobbled together which took a lot of administrative time.\u201d\n\nAPPROACH\n\nThey stream data to the cloud for real-time reporting\n\nUrban Outfitters migrated to a Snowflake cloud fed by Qlik Data Integration.\n\nThey could stream 50 GB of data per day from all those on-premises data sources.\n\nQlik Data Analytics became the company standard for in-store reporting and data analysis.\n\nWorking together, the two Qlik solutions created unprecedented access to critical data and enabled more informed action.\n\nReports that took hours, now take minutes.\n\nRESULTS\n\nData management makes information more useful\n\nQlik Data Integration enables small packets of data to be constantly streamed to the cloud rather than a big-bang approach that takes hours.\n\nPreviously, data could only be manipulated once the ETL (extract, transform, load) process had started, which meant hours of delay.\n\nNow, it takes fewer than five minutes for distribution centers, and at most 15 minutes for the order management system (OMS).\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU\n\nFind lost opportunities in your data\n\nThe takeaway here is that you can get the most from your data, even if you\u2019re dealing with archaic systems, incompatible platforms, decentralized data stores, or any of the other countless hurdles to business insights and planning.\n\nUrban Outfitters said: \u201cQlik has provided a longer runway and a more sustainable way to operate with fewer inhibitors than we had before.\n\nUsing it to obtain a holistic snapshot of a store\u2019s performance throughout the day is our ultimate aim.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what other customers are saying\n\n> We needed to consolidate data in one place, from heterogeneous sources,

GEORGIA-PACIFIC\n\nData Research Went From Thousands of Hours to Near Real Time Market leader Georgia-Pacific created an easy to use single source of truth for both developers and end users.\n\n[Watch Video](#)[Read Customer Story](/us/resource-library/georgia-pacific-customer-story)\n\n$millions\n\n### In projected savings Georgia-Pacific is saving millions of dollars.\n\nThat includes the human effort required to research, parse, contextualize, report, analyze, and digest data.\n\nAnd the opportunity to conduct some media operations in house.\n\n30,000\n\n### Hours a year saved Qlik Sense enabled customized dashboards and report-building applications that allow teams to dive into the data that matters.\n\n85%\n\n### Users accessing the platform on a regular basis Staff can focus on higher value priorities, such as optimizing marketing spend and identifying and responding to the results of campaigns.\n\nCHALLENGE\n\n## The very definition of siloed Data was spread across 30 siloed internal and external platforms.\n\nThat meant 60 to 70 different media partners all speaking a slightly different data language.\n\nThat cost the company millions of dollars and thousands of hours.\n\nPlus the cost of missed or unseen opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we become a data-driven organization,\u201d says Brian Sullivano, Senior Director, Marketing Technology at Georgia-Pacific.\n\n\u201cWe need our teams to ensure that we\u2019re creating value, increasing the speed at which we react to the marketplace and most importantly, delivering against the daily needs of our consumers.\u201d\n\nAPPROACH\n\n## Provide self service, ease of use, and speed Data is now accessible from a host of previously siloed sources and consolidated into a common language and format.\n\nWith Qlik Sense, Georgia-Pacific was quickly able to develop a range of dashboards and report-building applications.\n\nThese now allow individual teams to dive into the data that matters to them, as well as make it available to cross-functional teams.\n\nRESULTS\n\n## Better visibility translates into better decisions The deployment of Qlik Sense means data is now accessible from a host of previously siloed sources and consolidated into a common language and format.\n\n\u201cBy in-sourcing marketing mix modeling, we\u2019ve been able to understand the effectiveness of those investments more frequently and make better-informed decisions about our media choices,\u201d says Laura Knebusch, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Experience.\n\n\u201cAnd that goes beyond choosing between TV or digital \u2013 it extends to tactics, TV dayparts and partners.\n\nIt\u2019s had an immediate impact.\u201d\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU\n\n## Turn insight into opportunity With critical business data available centrally, quickly, and easily, your teams can elevate problem solving, find unexpected business and marketing opportunity, and maximize previously unseen advantage.\n\n\u201cTeams or individual cross-functional team members can go in and see every single dimension and measure what we have in the business today,\u201d Sullivano explains.\n\n\u201cThrough simple click-and-select-type capabilities, they\u2019re able to create their own reports, save those reports, publish them, share them with other people and collaborate on the details and information gained.\u201d\n\n## Here\u2019s what other customers are saying\n\n> We needed to consolidate data in one place, from heterogeneous sources, updated in almost real-time.\n\nThat\u2019s what Qlik enables for us.\n\n### C\u00e9dric Brignol Project Manager, Airbus\n\n> Qlik Gold Client solves a major problem typically encountered in SAP systems: size and complexity.\n\nThe solution allows us to select data precisely, transfer it to the test environment and start testing immediately.\n\n### Philipp Verbeek Test Manager, Lekkerland\n\n> We needed a BI partner that could enable us to report and dashboard with visualizations to provide our clients with more insights.\n\nWith Qlik we achieved this and enable our clients to make data-driven decisions.\n\nIt\\'s been a phenomenal partnership which will continue on.\n\n### CJ Jooste, Senior Executive, Business Development, IsoMetrix\n\n> We started an automation process with Qlik and now we only have half the people managing reports.\n\nThe other half is doing activities allowing us to leapfrog the competition by providing even more proactive analytics vs. reactive.\n\n### Alvin Gillis Director, WW Operations Reporting & Data Execution, Lenovo\n\n> By building AI into everything they deliver, while still maintaining a cloud agnostic approach, Qlik is meeting customers where they are in their AI journey while providing the flexibility needed to expand AI where and how it makes sense.\n\n### Dan Vesset Group Vice President, Analytics and Information Management Market

Keeping Tabs on Qlik Cloud Reporting It\u2019s here! Tabular Reporting in Qlik Cloud\n\n[![Headshot of blog author Julianne DeVincenzo.

I\u2019ve just finished typing up my last homework assignment of the year, and a few loud keyboard taps later, it\u2019s saved to a floppy disk, ready for printing at the school library. I grab my headphones and press play on my Walkman: Fleetwood Mac \u2013 Rumors. It\u2019s an old tape that belonged to my dad, and despite my favorite musician of all time, Stevie Nicks, joining their band almost 16 years before I was born, their otherworldly and soulful vocal harmonies never fail to bring me joy.\n\n![A grid of nine illustrated retro tech items, including a Tamagotchi, boombox, floppy disk, flip phone, cassette tape, Game Boy, portable cassette player, personal computer, and VHS tape.](https://res.cloudinary.com/talend/image/upload/w_600/q_auto/qlik/blogs/blog-post/spot-blog-keeping-tabs-on-qlik-cloud-reporting_imnndu.png) We all have memories like this. Whether it was your first computer, or that feeling when you first heard the dial-up tone for internet, certain technologies have a special place in our hearts and for many Qlik Customers those technologies include Excel and NPrinting. _At the early beginning, Vizubi NPrinting, was the printing (and exporting to Excel) module of a bigger product called Nuvola (the Italian word for cloud). The NPrinting code was extracted and translated to English to be sold worldwide via internet._ Beyond look and feel, the capabilities and familiarity associated with our favorite tech can usher in a powerful sense of nostalgia.\n\nHere is our tribute to nostalgia, an appreciation of marrying the past with the present driving entirely new innovations\u2026 [Tabular Reporting](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Reporting/cloud-tabular-reports-intro.htm) available in Qlik Cloud Analytics. The holidays came early for many Qlik users when Qlik launched Tabular Reporting in December, bringing a beloved QlikView NPrinting feature to the cloud. Tabular reporting capabilities have been a fundamental aspect of Qlik\u2019s reporting software dating back to QlikView. At its core, it enables users to organize and share data with stakeholders in structured table formats. There\u2019s a reason people still love and use Excel.\n\nWhile Tabular Reporting functionality has evolved over time, with Qlik continuously refining and improving the user experience, this beloved feature was originally left out of the reporting capabilities of Qlik Cloud Analytics. Until now\u2026 So \u2014 what exactly is Tabular Reporting with Qlik Cloud? What can it be used for? What is the state of this technology today? Let\u2019s get into it.\n\nCustomers now have the capability to conquer those ever-present, report distribution requirements. Whether you need paginated tables of sales/transactional data or repeated sheets of departmental analysis directly within an application in Qlik Cloud, we got you\u2026 With the introduction of Tabular Reporting, report developers can unleash their creativity, crafting tailor-made, intricately detailed XLS or PDF documents infused with Qlik data and visualizations.\n\nHighlights of Tabular Reporting:\n\n* **Create** dynamic tabular report template definition with data and visualizations from a Qlik Sense App from the familiarity of Microsoft Office 365 using Add-in technology.\n\n* **Define** report templates of Qlik data and visualizations and produce reports in PDF and Excel.\n\n* **Share** branded, presentation ready burst reports with internal and external stakeholders, with the self-service subscription ability to set up alerts.\n\n* **Manage** in app distribution lists to support burst distribution to any internal or external stakeholder.\n\n* **Control** with governed report task control from within an integrated report preparation experience.\n\n_And the cherry on top?_ Governed Report Tasks swoop in to burst reports to every corner of your distribution universe. Used for external stakeholder requirements, compliance agency reports and customers, allowing people without a license to consume insights generated by Qlik Cloud. Further solidifying the Qlik Cloud platform as the go-to source for operational decisions, customer communications, and beyond!\n\nQlik reporting capabilities will continue to expand with new features and functions that enhance collaboration and enables users to leverage the insights derived from reports across their organizations.\n\nIf you are hungry to learn how to use these collaborative and tabular reporting features and want an in-person, hands-on workshop then you are in luck. Come out to Orlando for [Qlik Connect ](https://www.qlikconnect.com/event/b6714110-5f41-4df1-9735-6b0007500a2e/websitePage:d8250be0-b1b9-4524-b2e8-cd8508c14979?utm_campaign=7013z000001vmSqAAI&utm_content=QlikInternal&utm_medium=qlikinternal&utm_mpt_id=CXJHBW&utm_source=Internal&utm_team=COM&utm_term=Internal)in June.

So why wait? Pour yourself a cup of coffee, fire up your browser, and experience the features you have been longing for.

[Read Customer Story](/us/resource-library/qlik-empowers-company-wide-insights-with-embedding)\n\n1300 ### Active users More than one third of the company actively takes advantage of analytics, integrating data into presentations, websites, applications, and other business products.\n\n10X ### Increase in usage Intuit didn\u2019t have to provide user training for the portal. The ease and consistency of the UI and UX helped create a more data-driven company with a modern, accessible approach.\n\n1 ### Company-wide portal Users can modify dashboards quickly and easily with an intuitive drag and drop UI.\n\nCHALLENGE ## Company data was too complex and difficult to use The complexity of their data setup put a high cognitive load on employees. And because analytics were not automatically updated across various platforms, leaders got reports and gave presentations using information that wasn\u2019t always up to date.\n\nAPPROACH ## An easy-to-use portal makes data accessible and usable Data from both Qlik Sense\u00ae and other third-party sources like AWS flow into the One Intuit Portal through Qlik Sense\u2019s API integrations. The APIs also create reusable components that can serve as embedded analytics. Intuit\u2019s end users then consume the data via a single page application on the React framework.\n\nRESULTS ## Quicker decisions based on real-time analytics The embedded analytics enabled by Qlik Sense\u2019s APIs are a game changer. Embedded analytics seamlessly integrate analytic content into other business products, websites and applications.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU ## The easier to use, the better Putting the time into making complex data analytics easy to consume pays dividends. Intuit always valued data, but now it is a more data-driven company with a modern, accessible approach. Over the past two years, usage has grown 10x for the embedded analytics the team supports.\n\n## Here\u2019s what other customers are saying > We needed to consolidate data in one place, from heterogeneous sources, updated in almost real-time. That\u2019s what Qlik enables for us. ### C\u00e9dric Brignol Project Manager, Airbus\n\n## Resources to help you gain insights in minutes [![Front view of an Airbus aircraft on a runway with the word \\\"AIRBUS\\\" overlaid on the image.](https://res.cloudinary.com/talend/image/upload/w_423/q_auto/qlik/resource-library/customer-story/resource-cs-airbus_tax0i4.jpg)Customer StoryAirbus Consolidates Data Sources to Optimize Aircraft ProductionRead Customer Story](/us/resource-library/airbus-consolidates-data-sources-to-optimize-aircraft-production)\n\n---\n\n**Article: 12**\nURL: https://www.qlik.com/us/solutions/customers/customer-stories/dominos\nContent: Domino's Radically Improves Efficiency, Customer Service \u2014 and Sales with Real-time Data and Analytics\n\nDomino's has leveraged real-time data and analytics to enhance operational efficiency and customer service.\n\nThis transformation has led to significant improvements in sales performance.\n\nVirtual EventVisionary Voices Episode 6: Cloud, AI, and the Analytics RevolutionExplore how AI is supercharging analytics in the series finale of Visionary Voices in AI.Learn More\n\nCustomer StoriesMore than 40,000 customers find answers with Qlik.\n\nAnalyticsTake action with AI-powered insightLearn More\n\nCUSTOMER STORYIntuit Simplifies Analytics with a Company-wide PortalRead More\n\nDomino's Radically Improves Efficiency, Customer Service \u2014 and Sales with Real-time Data and AnalyticsRead More\n\nUrban Outfitters Reduces Store Level Reporting from Hours to MinutesRead More\n\nData Research Went From Thousands of Hours to Near Real Time at Georgia-PacificRead More\n\nView Customer Stories\n\nCASE STUDY // DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA\n\nReal-time Data and Analytics Radically Improve Efficiency, Customer Service \u2014 and Sales Emphasis on innovation helps Domino\u2019s achieve more than 50 percent of all global retail sales from digital channels.\n\n85,000\n\ndata sources integrated\n\nStructured and unstructured data sources were integrated to get a single view of its customers and global operations.\n\n17TB\n\nof standardized managed data\n\nBusiness intelligence and advanced analytics required a streamlined and standardized architecture.\n\n1\n\ncentralized data tracker\n\nData is collected from the company\u2019s point of sales systems, 26 supply chain centers, and its channels.\n\nCHALLENGE\n\nWorld\u2019s largest pizza company was drowning in data\n\nThere are more than 15,000 stores in 85-plus markets, with customer data pouring in from every conceivable platform.\n\nThe company wanted to integrate all that data \u2014 85,000 structured and unstructured data sources \u2014 to get a single view of its customers and global operations.\n\nUnfortunately, their IT architecture prevented it.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a standard way to ingest data,\u201d says Dan Djuric, Vice President, Global Infrastructure and Enterprise Information Management.\n\n\u201c We also had more than 11,000 business users, 35 data scientists, and multiple marketing agencies \u2014 and all of them wanted to build their own database.\u201d\n\nAPPROACH\n\nA unified platform that manages data and provides real-time insight and analytics\n\nDomino\u2019s selected Talend\u00ae Data Fabric.\n\nThey also built a comprehensive data tracker which feeds Domino\u2019s Enterprise Management Framework and real-time data streaming.\n\nIt\u2019s combined with third party visualization and analytics solutions.\n\nWith a modern data platform in place, Domino\u2019s now has a trusted, single source of truth that helps improve business performance \u2014 from logistics to financial forecasting \u2014 while enabling one-to-one buying experiences across multiple touchpoints.\n\n\u201cWe think of it as giving store managers a smart watch for their in-store operations,\u201d said Kripakar Krishnamurthy, Director, Enterprise Data Engineering, Platforms and Architecture at Domino\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe want them to have reliable information about what\u2019s happening right now so they can maximize efficiency, deliver a superior customer experience, and boost their sales.\u201d\n\nRESULTS\n\nE-commerce with pepperoni\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become an e-commerce company that sells pizza. Talend has helped us make that digital transformation,\u201d exclaimed Djuric.\n\nWith real-time data and analytics, store managers can quickly see daily orders, prep time, delivery vs. pick-up, and more.\n\nThey can project demand and forecast staffing requirements.\n\n\u201cWe were already producing a lot of real-time information, and now put it to better use,\u201d Krishnamurthy noted.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our store managers to see what\u2019s ahead and make the right moves.\u201d\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU\n\nData is only worth what you can do with it\n\nVast data and multiple sources can be an untapped resource.\n\nBut it can also tap other resources as you attempt to analyze or contextualize it.\n\nBut a unified, agile, scalable data platform can capture, cleanse, standardize, enrich, store, and distribute data.\n\nIt becomes an asset.\n\nDjuric observes, \u201cWe\u2019re an aggressively aspirational company, and store growth is very important.\n\nWe needed to make sure we were on a platform that could scale, and Talend fulfills that requirement.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what other customers are saying\n\nWe needed to consolidate data in one place, from

from Hours to Minutes\n\nRetail leader uses real-time data to support in-the-moment decisions.\n\n50GB\n\nDaily streamed data\n\nRapid real-time data access boosts store performance by giving staff the information they need when they need it.\n\n240+\n\nQlik apps in use\n\nStore staff can make quick decisions, see current challenges, plan for the future, and appreciate the impact their work has on the wider picture.\n\n650+\n\nStore locations worldwide\n\nAccess to an array of dashboards and reports updated with fresh data every two minutes enables quick, in-store decision-making.\n\nCHALLENGE\n\nData was locked inside 650-plus stores\n\nGathering actionable data from more than 650 stores spread throughout the USA, Europe, and UK was a huge problem.\n\nTime zones, operating styles of three business brands, and different information systems created remarkable challenges.\n\nCovid-19 made it even worse, because of store closures and inconsistent pandemic strategies.\n\n\u201cWe were dealing with many different systems and technologies, so we could not easily gather, explore, or learn from information,\u201d said Director of Workforce Management, Joanna Matthy.\n\n\u201cIt meant that reports had to be cobbled together which took a lot of administrative time.\u201d\n\nAPPROACH\n\nThey stream data to the cloud for real-time reporting\n\nUrban Outfitters migrated to a Snowflake cloud fed by Qlik Data Integration.\n\nThey could stream 50 GB of data per day from all those on-premises data sources.\n\nQlik Data Analytics became the company standard for in-store reporting and data analysis.\n\nWorking together, the two Qlik solutions created unprecedented access to critical data and enabled more informed action.\n\nReports that took hours, now take minutes.\n\nRESULTS\n\nData management makes information more useful\n\nQlik Data Integration enables small packets of data to be constantly streamed to the cloud rather than a big-bang approach that takes hours.\n\nPreviously, data could only be manipulated once the ETL (extract, transform, load) process had started, which meant hours of delay.\n\nNow, it takes fewer than five minutes for distribution centers, and at most 15 minutes for the order management system (OMS).\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU\n\nFind lost opportunities in your data\n\nThe takeaway here is that you can get the most from your data, even if you\u2019re dealing with archaic systems, incompatible platforms, decentralized data stores, or any of the other countless hurdles to business insights and planning.\n\nUrban Outfitters said: \u201cQlik has provided a longer runway and a more sustainable way to operate with fewer inhibitors than we had before.\n\nUsing it to obtain a holistic snapshot of a store\u2019s performance throughout the day is our ultimate aim.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what other customers are saying\n\n> We needed to consolidate data in one place, from heterogeneous sources,

GEORGIA-PACIFIC\n\nData Research Went From Thousands of Hours to Near Real Time Market leader Georgia-Pacific created an easy to use single source of truth for both developers and end users.\n\n[Watch Video](#)[Read Customer Story](/us/resource-library/georgia-pacific-customer-story)\n\n$millions\n\n### In projected savings Georgia-Pacific is saving millions of dollars.\n\nThat includes the human effort required to research, parse, contextualize, report, analyze, and digest data.\n\nAnd the opportunity to conduct some media operations in house.\n\n30,000\n\n### Hours a year saved Qlik Sense enabled customized dashboards and report-building applications that allow teams to dive into the data that matters.\n\n85%\n\n### Users accessing the platform on a regular basis Staff can focus on higher value priorities, such as optimizing marketing spend and identifying and responding to the results of campaigns.\n\nCHALLENGE\n\n## The very definition of siloed Data was spread across 30 siloed internal and external platforms.\n\nThat meant 60 to 70 different media partners all speaking a slightly different data language.\n\nThat cost the company millions of dollars and thousands of hours.\n\nPlus the cost of missed or unseen opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we become a data-driven organization,\u201d says Brian Sullivano, Senior Director, Marketing Technology at Georgia-Pacific.\n\n\u201cWe need our teams to ensure that we\u2019re creating value, increasing the speed at which we react to the marketplace and most importantly, delivering against the daily needs of our consumers.\u201d\n\nAPPROACH\n\n## Provide self service, ease of use, and speed Data is now accessible from a host of previously siloed sources and consolidated into a common language and format.\n\nWith Qlik Sense, Georgia-Pacific was quickly able to develop a range of dashboards and report-building applications.\n\nThese now allow individual teams to dive into the data that matters to them, as well as make it available to cross-functional teams.\n\nRESULTS\n\n## Better visibility translates into better decisions The deployment of Qlik Sense means data is now accessible from a host of previously siloed sources and consolidated into a common language and format.\n\n\u201cBy in-sourcing marketing mix modeling, we\u2019ve been able to understand the effectiveness of those investments more frequently and make better-informed decisions about our media choices,\u201d says Laura Knebusch, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Experience.\n\n\u201cAnd that goes beyond choosing between TV or digital \u2013 it extends to tactics, TV dayparts and partners.\n\nIt\u2019s had an immediate impact.\u201d\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU\n\n## Turn insight into opportunity With critical business data available centrally, quickly, and easily, your teams can elevate problem solving, find unexpected business and marketing opportunity, and maximize previously unseen advantage.\n\n\u201cTeams or individual cross-functional team members can go in and see every single dimension and measure what we have in the business today,\u201d Sullivano explains.\n\n\u201cThrough simple click-and-select-type capabilities, they\u2019re able to create their own reports, save those reports, publish them, share them with other people and collaborate on the details and information gained.\u201d\n\n## Here\u2019s what other customers are saying\n\n> We needed to consolidate data in one place, from heterogeneous sources, updated in almost
