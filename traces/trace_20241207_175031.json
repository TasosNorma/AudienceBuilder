Today we\u2019re focusing on customers who migrated from a cloud data warehouse to Snowflake and some of the benefits they saw.\n\nA consolidated data system to accommodate a big(ger) WHOOP\n\nWhen a company experiences exponential growth over a short period, it\u2019s easy for its data foundation to feel a bit like it was built on the fly.\n\nData becomes distributed across multiple platforms; different teams end up using different tools.\n\nThey watch costs skyrocket while performance degrades.\n\nIn essence, that was the story of WHOOP, the Boston-based wearable technology company aimed at enhancing human performance and endorsed by superstar athletes such as LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nBefore it migrated to Snowflake in 2022, WHOOP was using a catalog of tools \u2014 Amazon Redshift for SQL queries and BI tooling, Dremio for a data lake, PostgreSQL databases and others \u2014 that had ultimately become expensive to manage and difficult to maintain, let alone scale.\n\nIn Snowflake, WHOOP found a simplified, fully managed platform with near-unlimited scalability and strong governance controls \u2014 in short, everything its previous system lacked.\n\nAnd the availability of a large network of partners who offer solutions to a whole range of problems has been an invaluable asset.\n\nThe move itself took just a matter of three months, including the time it took to clean up and organize much of its existing data to set WHOOP up for the future.\n\nNow, the company is enjoying the benefits of Snowflake\u2019s performance, simplicity and data governance.\n\nWith separated compute across warehouses, there\u2019s no longer any worry about one team\u2019s queries straining another\u2019s resources, and features such as Iceberg Tables are simplifying pipelines and saving the company money.\n\nNexon finds 7x performance improvements by unifying its massive data stores\n\nFounded in 1994, Nexon is a company engaged in the production, development and operation of online games and Virtual Worlds.\n\nServing a company that has games available in more than 190 countries and employs more than 8,000 people, its data engineering team is always running.\n\nProcessing some 90,000 tables per day, the team oversees the ingestion of more than 100 terabytes of data from upward of 8,500 events daily.\n\nSo when the company sought to unify all of its data on a single platform, it knew it needed something scalable, reliable, secure and convenient.\n\nMoving its data warehousing workload from a cloud data warehouse to Snowflake and from legacy Spark to Snowpark, Nexon saw a sevenfold performance improvement, translating to $4.5 million in cost savings annually.\n\nWith an internal user base of 2,000 \u2014 and growing \u2014 the company particularly appreciated the seamless data access controls and the ability to securely share data with just a few simple clicks.\n\nWith Snowpark, Nexon found processing speeds to be equally fast but more convenient and cost-effective since data never has to move off of Snowflake.\n\nA simpler, better solution\n\nWhile a desire to consolidate and make sense of their data foundations drove the move to Snowflake for both WHOOP and Nexon, the companies also enjoyed immediate improvements in performance, ease of use and cost.\n\nSnowflake\u2019s deep well of partners and the growing number of tools that integrate seamlessly with its platform offer the flexibility to tackle each customer\u2019s unique challenges.\n\nTo learn more about migrating and modernizing your legacy data platform, visit our Migrate to the AI Data Cloud web page or read more customer stories to find out how companies such as Lucid, Big Fish Games and Business Insider have found success with Snowflake.",

Companies hampered by legacy data architectures are often plagued by a high total cost of ownership (TCO), an inability to govern data, and a lack of scalability as their data volumes grow.\n\nThe Snowflake Data Cloud gives you the flexibility to build a modern architecture of choice to unlock value from your data. Snowflake was built from the ground up in the cloud. Unbound by the limitations of a legacy on-premises solution, its multi-cluster shared data architecture separates compute from storage, allowing data teams to easily scale up and down based on their needs.\n\nToday, simplifying its data platform on Snowflake has enabled Marriott to achieve transparency and control of its data, faster speed to market, improved collaboration and data sharing, a better user experience, and lower TCO. With Snowflake, Marriott has seen a dramatic improvement in performance and cost savings in comparison to Spark and Hive-based workloads.\n\nMany users from Marriott have commented on their improved experience with Snowflake, mentioning queries that used to take 5 hours or time out on Netezza now take 1 hour on Snowflake.
