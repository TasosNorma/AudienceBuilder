And they are looking for more.\n\nMenlo says these first 18 were selected from thousands of applicants. They include startups working on recruiting software; autonomous coding; interpretability research (understanding how models make decisions); fintech compliance and tax apps; radiology image analysis and chart reviewing apps; non-human identity cybersecurity; customer engagement software; and a consumer nutrition app.\n\nPlus there are eight more accepted into the program that are still in stealth, Menlo says.\n\nThis program is something of a cross between a typical corporate startup program (like Nvidia\u2019s Inception or Microsoft for Startups), where startups get usage credits and educational resources, and an incubator where they get company-building attention and investment.\n\nThe fund will write checks of $100,000 or more into startups \u2014 from pre-seed to Series B \u2014 and provide them with $25,000 worth of credits for Anthropic\u2019s models.\n\nMenlo is a major backer of Anthropic, and this fund helps both get in the middle of the next big thing for AI coming in 2025: a focus beyond the foundational models and AI infrastructure and into the new apps that run on top of them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the biggest investors in Anthropic and huge fans of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Menlo Ventures partner Tim Tully told TechCrunch in July when the program launched. \u201cWe thought this was an opportunity for us to do something together, where we can see the ecosystem and find great companies that are building on Anthropic or AI more broadly.\u201d",

Menlo will use the firm\u2019s proprietary machine learning tool to score and rank applications, Tully said, adding that the diligence process on these companies is expected to be more 'lightweight' than for a typical investment by the firm.\n\n---\n\n**Article: 2**\nURL: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/?deeplink=expertise-faq--1#expertise-faq-item-70541f37c1\nContent: NVIDIA Home\n\nNVIDIA Home Menu\n\nMenu icon\n\nClose icon\n\nShopping Cart\n\nSearch icon\n\nVisit your regional NVIDIA website for local content, pricing, and where to buy partners specific to your country.\n\nProducts\n\nHardware\n\nSoftware\n\nGaming and Creating\n\nLaptops and Workstations\n\nCloud and Data Center\n\nNetworking\n\nGPUs\n\nEmbedded Systems\n\nApplication Frameworks\n\nApps and Tools\n\nGaming and Creating\n\nInfrastructure\n\nCloud Services\n\nSolutions\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nData Center and Cloud Computing\n\nDesign and Simulation\n\nRobotics and Edge Computing\n\nHigh-Performance Computing\n\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\n\nIndustries\n\nIndustries\n\nOverview\n\nArchitecture, Engineering, Construction & Operations\n\nAutomotive\n\nConsumer Internet\n\nEnergy\n\nFinancial Services\n\nGaming\n\nGlobal Public Sector\n\nHealthcare and Life Sciences\n\nHigher Education and Research\n\nIndustrial\n\nManufacturing\n\nMedia and Entertainment\n\nRestaurants and Quick-Service\n\nRetail and Consumer Packaged Goods\n\nRobotics\n\nSmart Cities and Spaces\n\nSupercomputing\n\nTelecommunications\n\nUS Public Sector\n\nFor You\n\nCreatives/Designers\n\nData Scientists\n\nDevelopers\n\nExecutives\n\nGamers\n\nISVs\n\nIT Professionals\n\nResearchers\n\nRoboticists\n\nStartups\n\nNVIDIA Studio\n\nOverview\n\nAccelerated Apps\n\nProducts\n\nCompare\n\nShop\n\nIndustries\n\nMedia and Entertainment\n\nManufacturing\n\nArchitecture, Engineering, and Construction\n\nAll Industries >\n\nEmpowering the World\u2019s Cutting\u2011Edge Startups\n\nJoin NVIDIA Inception\u2019s global network of over 19,000 technology startups.\n\nWhat Is NVIDIA Inception?\n\nNVIDIA Inception is a free program designed to help startups evolve faster through cutting-edge technology, opportunities to connect with venture capitalists, and access to the latest technical resources from NVIDIA.\n\nProgram Benefits\n\nUnlike traditional accelerators, NVIDIA Inception supports all stages of a startup\u2019s life cycle.

Funding status is an important indicator of startup maturity. The Inception team also uses this information to determine which members might be appropriate for VC introductions.\n\n###  What if I can\\'t disclose information about my customers? We recognize the concerns associated with disclosing sensitive customer information. If you\\'re unable to share information about your customers, feel free to select \\\"Can\\'t disclose\\\" and share any information that helps us better understand the market opportunity (e.g., customer\\'s business vertical(s), number of customers, proof of concept).\n\n###  What if my startup doesn\\'t currently generate annual recurring revenue (ARR)? Generating revenue is not a requirement for NVIDIA Inception membership. The program is designed to support startups of all stages.\n\n###  My startup is not incorporated yet. Can I still apply to the Inception Program? No. Your company needs to be incorporated, and you\\'ll need to provide the incorporation date in the application form.\n\n###  What support do you offer early-stage startups? Early-stage startups enrolled in NVIDIA Inception benefit from free NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) training credits, SDK access, preferred pricing on select hardware and software, and free cloud credits.\n\n###  What GPU discounts are available to NVIDIA Inception members? Members benefit from preferred pricing on a subset of our enterprise-grade GPUs. NVIDIA doesn\\'t sell directly to Inception members, and we don\\'t maintain pricing control over our suppliers. The preferred pricing will function as a rebate that will be deducted from the standard price that any supplier provides.\n\n###  Do NVIDIA Inception members receive special access to GPUs that aren\\'t currently available on the market? At this time, NVIDIA Inception does not offer special access to GPUs that aren\u2019t generally available. NVIDIA can provide contact information for GPU suppliers that may have cards, but we cannot guarantee access to specific products.\n\n###  Is preferred pricing available for all NVIDIA hardware and software products? Members can request preferred pricing on a subset of our enterprise-grade GPUs. NVIDIA doesn\\'t sell directly to Inception program members, and we don\\'t maintain pricing control over our suppliers. The preferred pricing will function as a rebate that will be deducted from the standard price that any supplier provides.\n\n###  Why can\\'t I log in to the NVIDIA Inception Member Portal with my email address? The NVIDIA Inception Portal login requires the corporate email associated with your organization. Note that \u2018.nvidia\u2019 is no longer required as a part of your login credentials.\n\n###  Can I log in to the Inception Member Portal from the Inception Program webpage? Yes. The \u201cMember Sign-in\u201d button is at the top, right-hand corner of this page. You can also[ click here](https://nvcrm.my.site.com/Inception/s/welcome?ncid=no-ncid) to visit the sign-in page.\n\n###  How does my team access the Inception Member Portal? You can give members of your team access by adding members and modifying access rights within the [Inception Portal](https://nvcrm.my.site.com/Inception/s/welcome?ncid=no-ncid).\n\n###  How do I update or change my startup\\'s main contact for the Inception Portal? Send an email to InceptionProgram@nvidia.com (for members in China use inception_cn@nvidia.com) and we\u2019ll help update your main contact information.\n\n###  Why haven\\'t I received any Inception Program updates or benefit emails? Make sure that you\u2019re opted in to NVIDIA Developer News (in \u201cEmail Preferences\u201d) to receive the NVIDIA Inception newsletter. The newsletter highlights upcoming events, member benefits, and new developer tools and releases.\n\n###  How do I maximize the value of my membership after I\\'m accepted into the program? Once you\u2019re accepted, here are some recommendations for getting the most value out of your membership:   * Be sure to update your member profile in the Inception Portal every six months to remain eligible for benefits.\\n  * Explore the Inception Portal to learn about member benefits, marketing assets, and developer resources.\\n  * Opt in to communications from the Inception Program to receive emails about free workshops, technical webinars, and new member benefits.\\n  * Encourage members of your team to sign up for Inception Program communications, which often highlight trending technical topics and learning opportunities.\n\n###  I have additional questions regarding my Inception membership. Please send an email to InceptionProgram@nvidia.com (for members in China use inception_cn@nvidia.com).\n\nProducts   * [DGX

These models can perform a range of tasks, from captioning images and writing emails to solving math and coding challenges. With Anthropic\u2019s model ecosystem growing so quickly, it can be tough to keep track of which Claude models do what. To help, we\u2019ve put together a guide to Claude, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new models and upgrades arrive.\n\nClaude models are named after literary works of art: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The latest are:\n\nClaude 3 Haiku, a lightweight model.\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet, a midrange model.\n\nClaude 3 Opus, Anthropic\u2019s flagship model.\n\nCounterintuitively, Claude 3.5 Sonnet \u2014 the 'midrange' model \u2014 is the most capable Claude model at the moment. That\u2019s almost certain to change once the next version of Opus, Claude 3.5 Opus, is released.\n\nAll Claude models can analyze text as well as images, charts, graphs, and technical diagrams from documents. The models \u2014 which have a standard 200,000-token context window \u2014 can also follow multistep instructions, use tools (e.g., stock ticker trackers), and produce structured output in formats like JSON. A context window is the amount of data a model like Claude can analyze before generating new data, while tokens are subdivided bits of raw data (like the syllables 'fan,' 'tas,' and 'tic' in the word 'fantastic'). Two hundred thousand tokens is equivalent to about 150,000 words, or a 600-page novel.\n\nThe Claude models are available through Anthropic\u2019s API and managed platforms such as Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI. Here\u2019s the Anthropic API pricing:\n\nClaude 3 Haiku costs 25 cents per million input tokens (~750,000 words), or $1.25 per million output tokens\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet costs $3 per million input tokens, or $15 per million output tokens\n\nClaude 3 Opus costs $15 per million input tokens, or $75 per million output tokens.\n\nFor individual users and companies looking to simply interact with the Claude models via apps for the web, Android, and iOS, Anthropic offers a free Claude plan with rate limits and other usage restrictions. Upgrading to one of the company\u2019s subscriptions removes those limits and unlocks new functionality. The current plans are:\n\nClaude Pro, which costs $20 per month, comes with 5x higher rate limits, priority access, and previews of upcoming features.\n\nClaude Team, for small businesses, costs $30 per user per month.\n\nClaude Enterprise, for larger companies, allows companies to upload proprietary data into Claude.\n\nAs is the case with all generative AI models, there are risks associated with using Claude. The models occasionally make mistakes when summarizing or answering questions because of their tendency to hallucinate. They\u2019re also trained on public web data, some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license.\n\n---\n\n**Article: 5**\nURL: https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai-startups/\nContent: AI startups Headlines Only\n\nMenlo Ventures and Anthropic have picked the first 18 startups for their $100M fund\n\nPhysical AI startup BrightAI bootstraps to $80M in revenue\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of 44 US AI startups that have raised $100M or more in 2024\n\nBrightwave\u2019s AI agent helps asset managers find signal, and it\u2019s fundraising fast\n\n\u2018They wish this technology didn\u2019t exist\u2019: Perplexity responds to News Corp\u2019s lawsuit\n\nHow customer service AI startup Neuron7 convinced Keith Block to invest\n\nEven the \u2018godmother of AI\u2019 has no idea what AGI is\n\nSalesforce Ventures ups its AI fund to $1B, doubling it again\n\nCalifornia\u2019s legislature just passed AI bill SB 1047; here\u2019s why some hope the governor won\u2019t sign it\n\nBorn from San Francisco\u2019s AI hackathons, Agency lets you see what your AI agents do\n\nNearly a decade before co-founding Cohere, Nick Frosst thought he was late to AI\n\nMenlo Ventures and Anthropic team up on a $100M AI fund\n\nHere are India\u2019s biggest AI startups based on how much money they\u2019ve raised\n\nHow 2 high school teens raised a $500K seed round for their API startup (yes, it\u2019s AI)\n\nBig Tech companies are plowing money into AI startups, which could help them dodge antitrust concerns\n\nFrench AI startup H raises $220M seed round\n\nHow Y Combinator\u2019s founder-matching service helped medical records AI startup Hona land $3M\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI shows there\u2019s more money on the sidelines for AI startups\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned from the women behind the AI revolution\n\nThese AI startups stood out the most in Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2024 batch\n\nAI startups\u2019 margin profile could ding their long-term worth\n\nEU to expand support for AI startups to tap its supercomputers for model training\n\nToday\u2019s AI funding rush reminds me of the fintech investing hype of 2021\n\nHow to bootstrap an AI startup\n\n15 investors lift the lid on the biggest surprises of H1 2023\n\nSo you want to launch an AI startup\n\nFormer Salesforce exec Bret Taylor is teaming up with Google AR/VR vet Clay Bavor on mystery startup\n\n4 questions to ask when evaluating AI prototypes for bias\n\nAs AI pervades biotech, what are investors looking for in 2023\n\n---\n",

And they are looking for more.\n\nMenlo says these first 18 were selected from thousands of applicants. They include startups working on recruiting software; autonomous coding; interpretability research (understanding how models make decisions); fintech compliance and tax apps; radiology image analysis and chart reviewing apps; non-human identity cybersecurity; customer engagement software; and a consumer nutrition app.\n\nPlus there are eight more accepted into the program that are still in stealth, Menlo says.\n\nThis program is something of a cross between a typical corporate startup program (like Nvidia\u2019s Inception or Microsoft for Startups), where startups get usage credits and educational resources, and an incubator where they get company-building attention and investment.\n\nThe fund will write checks of $100,000 or more into startups \u2014 from pre-seed to Series B \u2014 and provide them with $25,000 worth of credits for Anthropic\u2019s models.\n\nMenlo is a major backer of Anthropic, and this fund helps both get in the middle of the next big thing for AI coming in 2025: a focus beyond the foundational models and AI infrastructure and into the new apps that run on top of them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the biggest investors in Anthropic and huge fans of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Menlo Ventures partner Tim Tully told TechCrunch in July when the program launched. \u201cWe thought this was an opportunity for us to do something together, where we can see the ecosystem and find great companies that are building on Anthropic or AI more broadly.\u201d\n\n\n** Secondary Articles **\nThese are the secondary articles.\n**Article: 1**\nURL: https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/17/menlo-ventures-and-anthropic-team-up-on-a-100m-ai-fund/\nContent: Silicon Valley VC firm Menlo Ventures, one of the biggest investors in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, on Wednesday said the two companies are teaming up to set up a $100 million initiative dubbed \u201cthe Anthology Fund\u201d to invest in pre-seed, seed and Series A artificial intelligence companies.\n\nMenlo recently climbed to the top of Anthropic\u2019s list of backers, closing a yet-to-be-announced, over $750 million funding round in the foundation model company, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Anthology Fund will write checks starting at $100,000 in startups and provide them with $25,000 worth of credits to use Anthropic\u2019s models.\n\nThe fund is accepting applications from startups through an online form. Menlo will use the firm\u2019s proprietary machine learning tool to score and rank applications, Tully said, adding that the diligence process on these companies is expected to be more 'lightweight' than for a typical investment by the firm.\n\n---\n\n**Article: 2**\nURL: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/?deeplink=expertise-faq--1#expertise-faq-item-70541f37c1\nContent: NVIDIA Home\n\nNVIDIA Home Menu\n\nMenu icon\n\nClose icon\n\nShopping Cart\n\nSearch icon\n\nVisit your regional NVIDIA website for local content, pricing, and where to buy partners specific to your country.\n\nProducts\n\nHardware\n\nSoftware\n\nGaming and Creating\n\nLaptops and Workstations\n\nCloud and Data Center\n\nNetworking\n\nGPUs\n\nEmbedded Systems\n\nApplication Frameworks\n\nApps and Tools\n\nGaming and Creating\n\nInfrastructure\n\nCloud Services\n\nSolutions\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nData Center and Cloud Computing\n\nDesign and Simulation\n\nRobotics and Edge Computing\n\nHigh-Performance Computing\n\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\n\nIndustries\n\nIndustries\n\nOverview\n\nArchitecture, Engineering, Construction & Operations\n\nAutomotive\n\nConsumer Internet\n\nEnergy\n\nFinancial Services\n\nGaming\n\nGlobal Public Sector\n\nHealthcare and Life Sciences\n\nHigher Education and Research\n\nIndustrial\n\nManufacturing\n\nMedia and Entertainment\n\nRestaurants and Quick-Service\n\nRetail and Consumer Packaged Goods\n\nRobotics\n\nSmart Cities and Spaces\n\nSupercomputing\n\nTelecommunications\n\nUS Public Sector\n\nFor You\n\nCreatives/Designers\n\nData Scientists\n\nDevelopers\n\nExecutives\n\nGamers\n\nISVs\n\nIT Professionals\n\nResearchers\n\nRoboticists\n\nStartups\n\nNVIDIA Studio\n\nOverview\n\nAccelerated Apps\n\nProducts\n\nCompare\n\nShop\n\nIndustries\n\nMedia and Entertainment\n\nManufacturing\n\nArchitecture, Engineering, and Construction\n\nAll Industries >\n\nEmpowering the World\u2019s Cutting\u2011Edge Startups\n\nJoin NVIDIA Inception\u2019s global network of over 19,000 technology startups.\n\nWhat Is NVIDIA Inception?\n\nNVIDIA Inception is a free program designed to help startups evolve faster through cutting-edge technology, opportunities to connect with venture capitalists, and access to the latest technical resources from NVIDIA.\n\nProgram Benefits\n\nUnlike traditional accelerators, NVIDIA Inception supports all stages of a startup\u2019s life cycle.

Funding status is an important indicator of startup maturity. The Inception team also uses this information to determine which members might be appropriate for VC introductions.\n\n###  What if I can\\'t disclose information about my customers? We recognize the concerns associated with disclosing sensitive customer information. If you\\'re unable to share information about your customers, feel free to select \\\"Can\\'t disclose\\\" and share any information that helps us better understand the market opportunity (e.g., customer\\'s business vertical(s), number of customers, proof of concept).\n\n###  What if my startup doesn\\'t currently generate annual recurring revenue (ARR)? Generating revenue is not a requirement for NVIDIA Inception membership. The program is designed to support startups of all stages.\n\n###  My startup is not incorporated yet. Can I still apply to the Inception Program? No. Your company needs to be incorporated, and you\\'ll need to provide the incorporation date in the application form.\n\n###  What support do you offer early-stage startups? Early-stage startups enrolled in NVIDIA Inception benefit from free NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) training credits, SDK access, preferred pricing on select hardware and software, and free cloud credits.\n\n###  What GPU discounts are available to NVIDIA Inception members? Members benefit from preferred pricing on a subset of our enterprise-grade GPUs. NVIDIA doesn\\'t sell directly to Inception members, and we don\\'t maintain pricing control over our suppliers. The preferred pricing will function as a rebate that will be deducted from the standard price that any supplier provides.\n\n###  Do NVIDIA Inception members receive special access to GPUs that aren\\'t currently available on the market? At this time, NVIDIA Inception does not offer special access to GPUs that aren\u2019t generally available. NVIDIA can provide contact information for GPU suppliers that may have cards, but we cannot guarantee access to specific products.\n\n###  Is preferred pricing available for all NVIDIA hardware and software products? Members can request preferred pricing on a subset of our enterprise-grade GPUs. NVIDIA doesn\\'t sell directly to Inception program members, and we don\\'t maintain pricing control over our suppliers. The preferred pricing will function as a rebate that will be deducted from the standard price that any supplier provides.\n\n###  Why can\\'t I log in to the NVIDIA Inception Member Portal with my email address? The NVIDIA Inception Portal login requires the corporate email associated with your organization. Note that \u2018.nvidia\u2019 is no longer required as a part of your login credentials.\n\n###  Can I log in to the Inception Member Portal from the Inception Program webpage? Yes. The \u201cMember Sign-in\u201d button is at the top, right-hand corner of this page. You can also[ click here](https://nvcrm.my.site.com/Inception/s/welcome?ncid=no-ncid) to visit the sign-in page.\n\n###  How does my team access the Inception Member Portal? You can give members of your team access by adding members and modifying access rights within the [Inception Portal](https://nvcrm.my.site.com/Inception/s/welcome?ncid=no-ncid).\n\n###  How do I update or change my startup\\'s main contact for the Inception Portal? Send an email to InceptionProgram@nvidia.com (for members in China use inception_cn@nvidia.com) and we\u2019ll help update your main contact information.\n\n###  Why haven\\'t I received any Inception Program updates or benefit emails? Make sure that you\u2019re opted in to NVIDIA Developer News (in \u201cEmail Preferences\u201d) to receive the NVIDIA Inception newsletter. The newsletter highlights upcoming events, member benefits, and new developer tools and releases.\n\n###  How do I maximize the value of my membership after I\\'m accepted into the program? Once you\u2019re accepted, here are some recommendations for getting the most value out of your membership:   * Be sure to update your member profile in the Inception Portal every six months to remain eligible for benefits.\\n  * Explore the Inception Portal to learn about member benefits, marketing assets, and developer resources.\\n  * Opt in to communications from the Inception Program to receive emails about free workshops, technical webinars, and new member benefits.\\n  * Encourage members of your team to sign up for Inception Program communications, which often highlight trending technical topics and learning opportunities.\n\n###  I have additional questions regarding my Inception membership. Please send an email to InceptionProgram@nvidia.com (for members in China use inception_cn@nvidia.com).\n\nProducts   * [DGX

These models can perform a range of tasks, from captioning images and writing emails to solving math and coding challenges. With Anthropic\u2019s model ecosystem growing so quickly, it can be tough to keep track of which Claude models do what. To help, we\u2019ve put together a guide to Claude, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new models and upgrades arrive.\n\nClaude models are named after literary works of art: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The latest are:\n\nClaude 3 Haiku, a lightweight model.\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet, a midrange model.\n\nClaude 3 Opus, Anthropic\u2019s flagship model.\n\nCounterintuitively, Claude 3.5 Sonnet \u2014 the 'midrange' model \u2014 is the most capable Claude model at the moment. That\u2019s almost certain to change once the next version of Opus, Claude 3.5 Opus, is released.\n\nAll Claude models can analyze text as well as images, charts, graphs, and technical diagrams from documents. The models \u2014 which have a standard 200,000-token context window \u2014 can also follow multistep instructions, use tools (e.g., stock ticker trackers), and produce structured output in formats like JSON. A context window is the amount of data a model like Claude can analyze before generating new data, while tokens are subdivided bits of raw data (like the syllables 'fan,' 'tas,' and 'tic' in the word 'fantastic'). Two hundred thousand tokens is equivalent to about 150,000 words, or a 600-page novel.\n\nThe Claude models are available through Anthropic\u2019s API and managed platforms such as Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI. Here\u2019s the Anthropic API pricing:\n\nClaude 3 Haiku costs 25 cents per million input tokens (~750,000 words), or $1.25 per million output tokens\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet costs $3 per million input tokens, or $15 per million output tokens\n\nClaude 3 Opus costs $15 per million input tokens, or $75 per million output tokens.\n\nFor individual users and companies looking to simply interact with the Claude models via apps for the web, Android, and iOS, Anthropic offers a free Claude plan with rate limits and other usage restrictions. Upgrading to one of the company\u2019s subscriptions removes those limits and unlocks new functionality. The current plans are:\n\nClaude Pro, which costs $20 per month, comes with 5x higher rate limits, priority access, and previews of upcoming features.\n\nClaude Team, for small businesses, costs $30 per user per month.\n\nClaude Enterprise, for larger companies, allows companies to upload proprietary data into Claude.\n\nAs is the case with all generative AI models, there are risks associated with using Claude. The models occasionally make mistakes when summarizing or answering questions because of their tendency to hallucinate. They\u2019re also trained on public web data, some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license.\n\n---\n\n**Article: 5**\nURL: https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai-startups/\nContent: AI startups Headlines Only\n\nMenlo Ventures and Anthropic have picked the first 18 startups for their $100M fund\n\nPhysical AI startup BrightAI bootstraps to $80M in revenue\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of 44 US AI startups that have raised $100M or more in 2024\n\nBrightwave\u2019s AI agent helps asset managers find signal, and it\u2019s fundraising fast\n\n\u2018They wish this technology didn\u2019t exist\u2019: Perplexity responds to News Corp\u2019s lawsuit\n\nHow customer service AI startup Neuron7 convinced Keith Block to invest\n\nEven the \u2018godmother of AI\u2019 has no idea what AGI is\n\nSalesforce Ventures ups its AI fund to $1B, doubling it again\n\nCalifornia\u2019s legislature just passed AI bill SB 1047; here\u2019s why some hope the governor won\u2019t sign it\n\nBorn from San Francisco\u2019s AI hackathons, Agency lets you see what your AI agents do\n\nNearly a decade before co-founding Cohere, Nick Frosst thought he was late to AI\n\nMenlo Ventures and Anthropic team up on a $100M AI fund\n\nHere are India\u2019s biggest AI startups based on how much money they\u2019ve raised\n\nHow 2 high school teens raised a $500K seed round for their API startup (yes, it\u2019s AI)\n\nBig Tech companies are plowing money into AI startups, which could help them dodge antitrust concerns\n\nFrench AI startup H raises $220M seed round\n\nHow Y Combinator\u2019s founder-matching service helped medical records AI startup Hona land $3M\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI shows there\u2019s more money on the sidelines for AI startups\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned from the women behind the AI revolution\n\nThese AI startups stood out the most in Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2024 batch\n\nAI startups\u2019 margin profile could ding their long-term worth\n\nEU to expand support for AI startups to tap its supercomputers for model training\n\nToday\u2019s AI funding rush reminds me of the fintech investing hype of 2021\n\nHow to bootstrap an AI startup\n\n15 investors lift the lid on the biggest surprises of H1 2023\n\nSo you want to launch an AI startup\n\nFormer Salesforce exec Bret Taylor is teaming up with Google AR/VR vet Clay Bavor on mystery startup\n\n4 questions to ask when evaluating AI prototypes for bias\n\nAs AI pervades biotech, what are investors looking for in 2023\n\n---\n\n\n",
