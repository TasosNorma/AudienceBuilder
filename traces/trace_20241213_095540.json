To build this innovative model, Soniox turned to Databricks for its industry-leading Mosaic AI Training tools that simplified model development.\n\nWe just followed the documentation online, and within a few hours, we were operational and started running a job. We never had any problems. \u2013 Klemen Simonic, Founder/CEO\n\nSoniox, founded in 2020 by experienced AI researchers, is the originator of unsupervised learning for speech recognition. In 2022, they released their first product, a speech recognition AI with the highest level of accuracy for the major eight languages: German, Portuguese, Italian, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and English. Each foreign language AI model is bilingual, able to understand that language plus English to better facilitate business use cases.\n\nThe Soniox team was well-versed in training custom AI models, to say the least; before working with Databricks they had already trained one multilingual large language model (LLM), Soniox 7B. Yet they still turned to Databricks for support with training their next large multimodal LLM, Omnio, which has the ability to fully utilize all the information available in an audio signal and represents a significant advancement in the field of speech recognition.\n\nOmnio is the first large AI model can process speech and audio in a manner similar to how a human might. It can recognize and understand speech, identify separate speakers, and discern emotions and sentiment. It can even distinguish between background and human-made sounds.\n\nIn order to build this incredibly innovative model, Soniox had to wrangle Internet-scale datasets for audio and text. After some online research, Soniox found its way to Databricks and Mosaic AI Training.\n\nSimonic explained, \u201cWe aren\u2019t a typical Databricks customer; we have our own training loops and distributed training infrastructure. But when we started working with your team, it was clear that your tools were built for developers by developers. We love Mosaic AI training; it\u2019s easy to use.\u201d\n\nAlthough Soniox had used other infrastructure providers, they appreciated the compute availability and convenience of the Mosaic AI Training cluster.\n\nContinued Simonic, \u201cYou can tell that whoever built Mosaic AI Training really understands how to launch and train jobs. We have tried other platforms, and your platform has been the easiest way to start any job. Your team built the right features the right way and made them easy to use.\u201d\n\nAs a startup founder, Simonic originally perceived Databricks to be an enterprise-focused company. He was pleasantly surprised to get personalized support from his account team. \u201cIt\\'s really important to listen to your customers, even if they are an early-stage startup.\u201d\n\nSimonic continued, \u201cWhen technical challenges arise, it can be hard for startups because they lack a big organization\u2019s budget to support any failures.\u201d The personal attention that Simonic received from the Databricks team has given him confidence in the ability to work through any issues that may arise in future training runs.\n\nAlthough the Soniox team was initially drawn to the functionality of Mosaic AI Training, they appreciate that it is part of a broader GenAI ecosystem from Databricks that can support workloads from data ingestion to model serving.\n\nLooking ahead, Soniox plans to expand the capabilities of its speech-to-text and Omnio products so that it can transform users\u2019 interaction with audio in use cases that range from transcription to audio summarization to voice interaction, supporting industries like healthcare, legal, customer care and beyond.\n\nSoniox initially began as a research project to investigate how to leverage unlabeled audio data. Today, its groundbreaking speech recognition AI unlocks new possibilities in human-machine interaction.\n\nFor developers interested in experimenting with Soniox: https://console.soniox.com\n\nFor developers interested in exploring Omnio products: https://omnio.soniox.com\n\nFor organizations that want to fine-tune or pretrain their own models within Databricks: https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning/mosaic-ai-training\n\nTry Databricks for free",

To build this innovative model, Soniox turned to Databricks for its industry-leading Mosaic AI Training tools that simplified model development.\n\nWe just followed the documentation online, and within a few hours, we were operational and started running a job. We never had any problems. \u2013 Klemen Simonic, Founder/CEO\n\nSoniox, founded in 2020 by experienced AI researchers, is the originator of unsupervised learning for speech recognition. In 2022, they released their first product, a speech recognition AI with the highest level of accuracy for the major eight languages: German, Portuguese, Italian, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and English. Each foreign language AI model is bilingual, able to understand that language plus English to better facilitate business use cases.\n\nThe Soniox team was well-versed in training custom AI models, to say the least; before working with Databricks they had already trained one multilingual large language model (LLM), Soniox 7B. Yet they still turned to Databricks for support with training their next large multimodal LLM, Omnio, which has the ability to fully utilize all the information available in an audio signal and represents a significant advancement in the field of speech recognition.\n\nOmnio is the first large AI model can process speech and audio in a manner similar to how a human might. It can recognize and understand speech, identify separate speakers, and discern emotions and sentiment. It can even distinguish between background and human-made sounds.\n\nIn order to build this incredibly innovative model, Soniox had to wrangle Internet-scale datasets for audio and text. After some online research, Soniox found its way to Databricks and Mosaic AI Training.\n\nSimonic explained, \u201cWe aren\u2019t a typical Databricks customer; we have our own training loops and distributed training infrastructure. But when we started working with your team, it was clear that your tools were built for developers by developers. We love Mosaic AI training; it\u2019s easy to use.\u201d\n\nAlthough Soniox had used other infrastructure providers, they appreciated the compute availability and convenience of the Mosaic AI Training cluster.\n\nContinued Simonic, \u201cYou can tell that whoever built Mosaic AI Training really understands how to launch and train jobs. We have tried other platforms, and your platform has been the easiest way to start any job. Your team built the right features the right way and made them easy to use.\u201d\n\nAs a startup founder, Simonic originally perceived Databricks to be an enterprise-focused company. He was pleasantly surprised to get personalized support from his account team. \u201cIt\\'s really important to listen to your customers, even if they are an early-stage startup.\u201d\n\nSimonic continued, \u201cWhen technical challenges arise, it can be hard for startups because they lack a big organization\u2019s budget to support any failures.\u201d The personal attention that Simonic received from the Databricks team has given him confidence in the ability to work through any issues that may arise in future training runs.\n\nAlthough the Soniox team was initially drawn to the functionality of Mosaic AI Training, they appreciate that it is part of a broader GenAI ecosystem from Databricks that can support workloads from data ingestion to model serving.\n\nLooking ahead, Soniox plans to expand the capabilities of its speech-to-text and Omnio products so that it can transform users\u2019 interaction with audio in use cases that range from transcription to audio summarization to voice interaction, supporting industries like healthcare, legal, customer care and beyond.\n\nSoniox initially began as a research project to investigate how to leverage unlabeled audio data. Today, its groundbreaking speech recognition AI unlocks new possibilities in human-machine interaction.\n\nFor developers interested in experimenting with Soniox: https://console.soniox.com\n\nFor developers interested in exploring Omnio products: https://omnio.soniox.com\n\nFor organizations that want to fine-tune or pretrain their own models within Databricks: https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning/mosaic-ai-training\n\nTry Databricks for free\n\n\n** Secondary Articles **\nThese are the secondary articles.\n**Article: 1**\nURL: https://soniox.com/news/soniox-7B/\nContent: We are excited to release Soniox 7B, the most powerful large language model for its size to date.\n\nOutperforms Mistral 7B on all benchmarks\n\nOutperforms Mixtral 8X7B on almost all benchmarks\n\nMatches GPT-4 on some benchmarks\n\nSupports English and code with 8K context window\n\nBuilt on top of Mistral 7B with additional pre-training and fine-tuning\n\nReleased under Apache 2.0 license and can be used without restrictions\n\nUse it from Hugging Face or download zip\n\nDeploy it anywhere with vLLM, TensorRT-LLM or SkyPilot\n\nOver the past year, we have tried to develop an advanced AI assistant capable of performing complex tasks, including internet searches, analysis of gathered data, data presentation, and making predictions.\n\nThe primary limitations can be summarized as follows: Fragility, Inconsistency, Slowness, Cost.\n\nWe compared Soniox 7B with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, and GPT-4-1106-preview.\n\nThe benchmark results are presented in the table below.\n\nSoniox 7B outperforms Mistral 7B on all benchmarks by a large margin.\n\nSoniox 7B outperforms Mixtral 8x7B on 14 out of 17 benchmarks.\n\nSoniox 7B and GPT-4 have similar performance on 4 benchmarks, while GPT-4 dominates in other benchmarks.\n\nSonioxText dataset is our proprietary benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of executing NLP tasks on given texts.\n\nThe dataset comprises samples from sources such as Wikipedia articles, general and financial news, Reddit posts, scientific and medical papers, legal articles, source code documentation, website content, and video captions.\n\nWe have developed our own benchmarking pipeline to enable accurate and fair comparisons of different instruction-tuned LLMs.\n\nFor benchmarks such as MMLU, Math, AGIEval, HumanEval, and MBPP, we utilized external reference libraries for proper response parsing.\n\nSoniox SOC 2 Type 2\n\nHIPAA Compliant\n\nGDPR Compliant\n\n---\n\n**Article: 2**\nURL: https://soniox.com/products/omnio/\nContent: [Soniox](/) Products [Omnio](/products/omnio/)[Speech Recognition](/products/speech-recognition/) [Documentation](/docs/) [Pricing](/pricing/) Resources [Blog](/blog/)[Videos](/videos/) [Speech Recognition Benchmarks](/benchmarks/) Company [About us](/company/about/)[Contact](/contact/)[Careers](/company/careers/)[Policies](/company/policies/) [Soniox Console](https://console.soniox.com/playground/chat)\n\n## Omnio First AI model that can natively reason over audio like humans.
