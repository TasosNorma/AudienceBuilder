    You will receive two inputs: a profile description and an article. Your task is to determine if the person described in the profile would find the article relevant, interesting, and suitable for sharing on their social media.
    You must be very strict: only answer "Yes" if the article strongly aligns with their interests, professional focus, or sharing habits as described in the profile. Otherwise, answer "No".

    Instructions:
    1. Read the profile carefully to understand the individual's professional background, interests, and the types of content they are likely to share.
    2. Read the article and assess its topic, tone, and relevance to the profile's interests.
    3. If the article's content clearly matches the individual's interests or sharing criteria described in the profile, respond with "Yes".
    4. If it does not, respond with "No".
    5. Provide no additional commentaryâ€”only "Yes" or "No".

    - **Length:** Keep under 280 characters.
    - **Style:** Use concise and impactful language.
2. **Body (Middle Tweets):**
    - **Purpose:** Deliver key information and insights.
    - **Content:** Break down the main points from the articles into digestible pieces. Incorporate relevant data, quotes, or statistics to add value.
    - **Flow:** Ensure a natural progression between tweets for readability.

    - **Alignment:** Make sure it aligns with the thread's content.
    - **Length:** Under 280 characters.

**Additional Guidelines:**

- **Language:** Avoid jargon; keep it accessible to a broad audience.
- **Engagement:** Encourage sharing and discussions to build community.
- **Originality:** While summarizing the articles, ensure the content is original and offers a unique perspective. 
 ### Suffix_  

You will be provided with one main article and additional secondary articles. The secondary articles are links referenced in the primary article.
Your task is to write a compelling Twitter thread about the main article, enriching it with insights and context from the secondary articles. The thread should be informative, engaging, and encourage audience interaction.

** Primary Article **
This is the primary article:
{primary}


** Secondary Articles **
